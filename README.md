# Pizza 

__Arun Seetharam's__ recipe for pizza dough

## Instruments

1. Strong mixer - I use the [KitchenAid Professional 600](https://www.kitchenaid.com/countertop-appliances/stand-mixers/bowl-lift-stand-mixers/p.professional-600-series-6-quart-bowl-lift-stand-mixer.kp26m1xwh.html)
2. Pizza oven - I use the [Ooni Koda](https://ooni.com/products/ooni-koda)
3. Weighing scale
4. Accessories:  cutting board, peel, pizza cutter, etc.


## Ingredients

1. King Arthur Bread Flour - 593g
2. Water, room temperature - 367g (62% hydration) 
3. Salt - 12g (2%)
4. Yeast - 1g (0.2%)
5. Olive oil - 12g (2%)
6. Sugar - 12g (2%)

Notes:

* Do not substitute bread flour with all-purpose flour or any other brand of bread flour.  Bread flour has a higher protein content and is essential for a chewy crust.  I use [King Arthur Bread Flour](https://shop.kingarthurbaking.com/items/king-arthur-unbleached-bread-flour-5-lb) and get consistent results.
* I use [Fleischmann's Active Dry Yeast](https://www.amazon.com/Fleischmanns-Active-Dry-Yeast-0-25/dp/B0049X2HAI) but any active dry yeast should work.
* IMHO, salt, sugar, olive oil type/brand does not change results much.


## Recipe

### Step 1:

1. Weigh 593g of flour, 12g salt, 1g yeast, 12g sugar, 12g olive oil into mixer bowl
2. Weigh out 367g of water, if cold, warm up in microwave
3. Add water to slowly to the mixer bowl while running it in low speed
4. Once all water is added, mix for 5 minutes

Note that adding all water at once will result in a sticky dough that is hard to handle.  Adding water slowly will allow the flour to absorb the water and result in a dough that is easy to handle. Also, add yeast and salt separately to avoid killing the yeast (different parts of the dough is fine).

### Step 2:

1. Cover the mixer bowl with a plastic wrap and let it rest for 10 minutes
2. After 10 minutes, put it in the fridge for 24 hours (or more)

The slow retard prevents yeast from uneven/rapid fermentation, which makes it more flavorful. I have tried 12 hours and 24 hours and I prefer the 24 hour version. 

### Step 3:

1. transfer, knead, cut
2. proof 2-3 hrs.

About 2-3 hrs before baking, transfer the dough to a work surface, knead a few times by hand to get start portioning to chunks. If you followed the above weights, you should end up with ~980-990g of dough, which can make 5 12" pizza's, each chunk ~196-200g. You can apply olive oil lightly on the surface of the tray so that it will be easier to lift off the dough ball.

### Step 4:

1. Bake!

When ready, the dough is soft and very easy to shape. Start flattening the ball from edges and work towards the center. Use AP flour/bread flour to make it non-sticky or even corn flour. Put the sauce, toppings, cheese and use the peel to transfer to oven. Watch and rotate teh pizza every 30-45 seconds, until it's done. Wait few mins once taken out and then slice and serve.
